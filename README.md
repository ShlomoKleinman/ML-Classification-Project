Machine Learning Car Accidents Classification and Clustering project.
This project aims to analyze car accidents by applying classification and clustering techniques to predict accident severity and discover hidden patterns.
The dataset contains various features related to car accidents, including location, time, weather conditions, and the severity of the accident. 
The project applies both supervised and unsupervised machine learning methods to classify accident severity and to cluster data based on similar accident characteristics.

Objectives
Classification: Predict accident severity (e.g., minor, major, or fatal) based on available features using classification algorithms.
Clustering: Uncover patterns in the dataset by clustering similar accidents together using unsupervised learning techniques.

Classification Model
Supervised learning algorithms used for classification include:
Logistic Regression
Decision Trees
Random Forest
Support Vector Machines (SVM)
Gradient Boosting

Clustering Model
Unsupervised learning algorithms used for clustering include:
K-Means Clustering
DBSCAN
